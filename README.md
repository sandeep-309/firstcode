# In Git, cloning is the act of making a copy of any target repository. The target repository can be remote or local. You can clone your repository from the remote repository to create a local copy on your system. Also, you can sync between the two locations.
 
Git Clone Command
The git clone is a command-line utility which is used to make a local copy of a remote repository. It accesses the repository through a remote URL.
Usually, the original repository is located on a remote server, often from a Git service like GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. The remote repository URL is referred to the origin.
$ git clone <repository URL>  
$ git clone https://github.com/examole/Git-Example.git
